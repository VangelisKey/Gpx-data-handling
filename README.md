The server works between different computers in the same local network (can work in 1 pc for testing).

There is one main server that is initialized with a number of workers and their IP's.
The server splits data, gives it to workers and then combines their results.

The client side is implemented via app.
You can send gpx files and receive statistics about your specific route.
Each user can also see their own statistics for all their submited routes and also compare to the average user/
